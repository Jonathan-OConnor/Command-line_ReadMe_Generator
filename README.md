## Description 
This project builds a ReadMe file based on user input. When the script is launched, the user is prompted on the command-line with a series of questions using the Inquirer javascript library. Once the user has responded to all the prompts, a ReadMe.md file is generated based on the inputs from the user in the same directory as the Index.js file.
